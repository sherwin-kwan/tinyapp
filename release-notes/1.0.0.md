Version 1.0.0, released 1 Oct 2020

## Known Issues

* This app is currently NOT connected to a database, all data is stored on the server and disappears when the server is closed
* Layout for many pages is subpar. This app was meant to practice Express and CRUD operations, CSS was not a priority.
* I have also had trouble getting browsers to recognise the custom stylesheet placed in */public/style/style.css*
* Password fields are not recognised as password fields in browsers
* Error messages aren't particularly specific and may be confusing

## Default Credentials

* For your information, there are currently three users created by default, as follows:

Name | Email | Password
---|---|---
Jack | some@random.com | *hunter2*
Jill | example@example.edu | *correct-horse*
Boss | daroot@theboss.com | *battery-staple*

"Boss" has admin privileges i.e. has all of the permissions available to all of the other users.
